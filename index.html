            CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to
            describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It
            defines how HTML elements should be displayed on screen, in print,
            or in other media. For an expert in HTML, proficiency in CSS is
            crucial for building a Web Site.
